# AI-QA-predictor
AI-QA-predictor is an MVVM-based desktop application that imports SLDV results and processes them using a Python end-to-end pipeline. It applies machine learning models (Random Forest and MLP) to predict false positives in the SLDV results and exports a new file with a prediction attribute.
